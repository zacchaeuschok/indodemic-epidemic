# Modelling the Interplay between Infodemic and Epidemic

## Overview

Anti-vaccine sentiment can be thought of as a culturally transmitted trait that persists in some populations. The spread of anti-vaccine sentiment can be 
modelled by analogy with the SIR model of a transmissable biological pathogen. We thus model the coupled dynamics of anti-vaccine sentiment (cultural pathogen) and
infection by an infectious agent against which a vaccine protects (biological pathogen) using an extended SIR framework.
